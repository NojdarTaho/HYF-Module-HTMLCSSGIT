- How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?
You can hide a file by moving it under a new filename. Fx, $ filename .new-filename
the way to display it in the CLI is to write ls command accompanied with -a (ls -a).



- How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?
you can use mkdir to make an directory. using command pwd shows you the location of your current folder. But to create multiple nested directories you have to use mkdir accompanied by -p. for example mkdir -p file1/file2.


- How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:
first message
second message
I was really confused about this question. I did not want to just google the answer, so i spent some time reading through all the material provided to me to have more grasp on understanding command line interface. I got some glimpses on echo command but did not get a full explanation about what echo can do. Hopefully i fund a video explaining that. In order to append the above output, i have to write echo -e ‘first message \nsecond message’.
This way i get the output first message in the first line and second message in a newline. I found other interesting uses for echo command. You can create a variable and then echoed by using echo command. for example, u can write myvar=“Nojdar”
and when you write echo $myvar it gives Nojdar as an output.
