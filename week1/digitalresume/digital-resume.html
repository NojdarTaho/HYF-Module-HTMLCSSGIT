            <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am from Syria. I am kurdish and was born in the city Kobani, but grew up in Aleppo. I currently live in Groningen. I have been living in Netherland for about 20 months.</p>
    <p>My passion lays in many things, but currently i am completly hooked with programing. <br>There is something about it that drives me to learn more and dive deeper into this unique world. I think it might be that feeling of making something from nothing. <br>Like bulding your own website amd having the total freedom of doing whatever you wish with it.</p>
